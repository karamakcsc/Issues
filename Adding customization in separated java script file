Hey ,
If you want to customize the sales invoice doctype. You need to follow these steps

    Inside frappe-bench/apps/[app_name]/[app_name] here you can create a folder of Custom

    Inside custom folder, Create a folder of sale invoice and then you need to create the files sales_invoice.js, sales_invoice.py and init.py file

    Andyou can do customization over here.

    Apart from this, you have to add these in hooks.py

For JS File
doctype_js = {
“sales_invoice” : “custom/sales_invoice/sales_invoice.js”,
}

For PY file
doc_events ={
“sales_invoice”:{
“validate”:"project_name.custom.sales_invoice.sales_invoice.validate_project”
}
}
